# 工事中
・主要サービスで本番障害が多発し始め、影響範囲（ユーザー・金額）が大きくなり始めてきた
・しかし、改善の兆しが皆無
・この課題を自分ごととして認識し、イニシアチブをとって改善しようとする人がほぼ皆無だった。
・会社文化的にも、技術中心のアプローチばかりで、プロセス改善のアイデアを持つ人がほとんどいなかった
・LINE自体、特にAgileをやっていなかった。




# Specialities
Can you make this a more personal story?
- It is not clear what is unique and different about your experience.
- what were the special challenges?
- what were the creative solutions?
- What makes this experience different?
    - Every organization adopting agile for the first time faces challenges.


## Uniqueness of SET
- You may have an unique angle by telling us more about your experience as the first member of the "SET" (Software Engineer in Test) team.
- Was this a new role in your organization?
- Why was this role created?
- What were some of the challenges you faced?


# The first paragraph
Not specific about your experience at all.



# 要確認
The Information about the Experience is a little better, but here too
I think there are opportunities for improvement.

# "Solved problems and improved processes"
- What kinds of problems did you encounter?
- What kinds of processes did you improve?
- What was meant by, "Clarified responsibilities and activities"?









# Abstract

## Sample
In this experience report, I present practical ideas to establish a new role, to improve development processes, and to proceed company-wide problem-solving from scratch in the very strongly technology-oriented company without a concept of process improvement.
In 2017, LINE Corporation has been growing very rapidly and globally. However, the company had been struggling with increase of outages and they had given negative impacts to users and company's profits. Since I joined LINE Corporation as the first member of “SET” (Software Engineer in Test), I and our team have been solving a wide variety of problems and outages by utilizing technical solutions and Agile methodologies based on my experiences as an Agile Coach. We have been pursuing "best for our users and business" fiercely with a series of experiments. Currently, teams that start utilizing our ideas are increasing in our company.





## オリジナル
If you need to start totally new activities (like Agile Adoption) in your organization, what should you do at first? You may face with discrepancies of objectives and responsibilities for your activities among stakeholders. Moreover, you may discover hidden needs that stakeholders haven't distinguished yet. When you are proceeding entirely new approaches and actions, it is inevitable to face a wide variety of challenges continuously. For instance, your activities may not work as you expected. Your supervisor may request you to expand your activities beyond your responsibilities.

For overcoming these situations, you need to update yourselves continuously to meet your moving goals.

In this talk, I will provide you clear experiences and patterns for solving problems by combining Technical excellence, Agile methodologies, and iterative experiments as SET in LINE Corporation.
Additionally, I will tell you the importance of updating ourselves continuously with our concrete experiences and examples: from software quality to software delivery, profitability, and organizational processes.

After this talk, you will understand a value, strength, and possibility of becoming a team of Transformational Leaders!

## Memo
・特に2017年頃から、LINEの主要サービスで本番障害が多発し始め、ユーザー・売上へのマイナスの影響が大きくなり始めてきた。
・一方で、この課題を自分ごととして認識し、イニシアチブをとって改善しようとする人がほぼ皆無で、改善の兆しも見えなかった。
・LINEの企業文化的にも技術偏重で、プロセス改善のアイデアを持つ人がほとんどいなかった。
・LINE自体、アジャイルは普及していなかった。
・シニアマネージャーの提案で、ScrumMaster・DevOpsエンジニア・SETの3職を新たに追加したが…
