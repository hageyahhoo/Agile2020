# TODO
- Specificな記述に改める


# 工事中
・主要サービスで本番障害が多発し始め、影響範囲（ユーザー・金額）が大きくなり始めてきた
・しかし、改善の兆しが皆無
・この課題を自分ごととして認識し、イニシアチブをとって改善しようとする人がほぼ皆無だった。
・会社文化的にも、技術中心のアプローチばかりで、プロセス改善のアイデアを持つ人がほとんどいなかった
・LINE自体、特にAgileをやっていなかった。




# Specialities
Can you make this a more personal story?
- It is not clear what is unique and different about your experience.
- what were the special challenges?
- what were the creative solutions?
- What makes this experience different?
    - Every organization adopting agile for the first time faces challenges.


## Uniqueness of SET
- You may have an unique angle by telling us more about your experience as the first member of the "SET" (Software Engineer in Test) team.
- Was this a new role in your organization?
- Why was this role created?
- What were some of the challenges you faced?


# The first paragraph
Not specific about your experience at all.



# 要確認
The Information about the Experience is a little better, but here too
I think there are opportunities for improvement.

# "Solved problems and improved processes"
- What kinds of problems did you encounter?
- What kinds of processes did you improve?
- What was meant by, "Clarified responsibilities and activities"?




# Abstract

## オリジナル
If you need to start totally new activities (like Agile Adoption) in your organization, what should you do at first? You may face with discrepancies of objectives and responsibilities for your activities among stakeholders. Moreover, you may discover hidden needs that stakeholders haven't distinguished yet. When you are proceeding entirely new approaches and actions, it is inevitable to face a wide variety of challenges continuously. For instance, your activities may not work as you expected. Your supervisor may request you to expand your activities beyond your responsibilities.

For overcoming these situations, you need to update yourselves continuously to meet your moving goals.

In this talk, I will provide you clear experiences and patterns for solving problems by combining Technical excellence, Agile methodologies, and iterative experiments as SET in LINE Corporation.
Additionally, I will tell you the importance of updating ourselves continuously with our concrete experiences and examples: from software quality to software delivery, profitability, and organizational processes.

After this talk, you will understand a value, strength, and possibility of becoming a team of Transformational Leaders!
