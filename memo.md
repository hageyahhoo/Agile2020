I would like to hear more about your experience in this journey.
- What was your role?
    -> SET & (former) Agile Coach
- your challenges and how did you address those challenges.
    - Web上で、これらの情報がわかりづらい（論文を読んでもらう前ではねられている）

I have to agree with the other reviewers that this is too general.
Some things that caught my eye, and that I want to know more about, are:

- What kinds of software and organizational problems are we talking about?
How did Agile methodologies help?
What kinds of methodologies?
For example, the new Onboarding tool "Sebas report" - what specifically about this is agile? what problem did it solve?

- What does "creating solutions from scratch" mean?
How do I recognize either problems that require "solutions from scratch" or outcomes in my own organization that meet your understanding of "solutions from scratch"?

- You talk about combining technical excellence and experiments - what do these experiments look like, and what technical elements do you bring to them?



## Idea
Invention "Sebas Report":
- I focused on emphasizing that it was the result of "Learning Session".
- However, it is vague that how Agile methodologies helped.
- Actually, we utilized 1) "Lean Startup" to know users concerns, 2) released it daily with CI/CD.



## Solutions to problems
- Problems
    - MSA increase of outages but there were no ideas
- Innovative ideas
    - e.g.) Test Automation with Zipkin to reduce MTTR
* Not concrete examples of techniques, tools, and solutions
