# Memo
[Special Challenges]
・Outage多発などの課題認識が全社的に認識・共有されていない
・プロセス改善のアイデアと具体的な方法論がない
・SETという役職を設けただけで、具体的な課題認識・解決方針のアイデアを誰も持っていない
・味方がいない

[Creative Solutions]
課題発見と解決方法を見つけ、味方を作る
・Product Discoveryを活用して、組織の真の課題を見つけ、共通認識を構築した
・毎週技術的成果を出し続けることで、技術者の関心を高め味方につけた
・少しずつ施策・成果を見せながら合意をとっていく

[Different]
プロセス改善の経験のない会社であったため、少しずつ施策・成果を見せながら合意をとっていくアプローチは非常に有効で、味方を増やすことに有用だった。
また、3 KPIsが判断基準・共通語彙としても機能した。



# Specialities
Can you make this a more personal story?
- what were the special challenges?
- what were the creative solutions?
- What makes this experience different?
    - Every organization adopting agile for the first time faces challenges.


## Uniqueness of SET
- You may have an unique angle by telling us more about your experience as the first member of the "SET" (Software Engineer in Test) team.
- Was this a new role in your organization?
- Why was this role created?
- What were some of the challenges you faced?



# 要確認
The Information about the Experience is a little better, but here too
I think there are opportunities for improvement.

# "Solved problems and improved processes"
- What kinds of problems did you encounter?
- What kinds of processes did you improve?
- What was meant by, "Clarified responsibilities and activities"?



# Abstract
If you need to start totally new activities in an organization which doesn't know a concept of process improvement, what should you do at first? Especially in the very strongly technology-oriented one with urgent critical business issues?

It is very hard to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues in such an environment and a situation. However, it is more difficult to proceed with radically new actions alone. Therefore, we need to obtain consent from them to go ahead.

I experienced that creating solutions "from scratch" by combining technical solutions and Agile methodologies worked well in these challenging conditions.

In this talk, I will provide you practical ideas we reflected, experimented, and succeeded as SET in LINE Corporation. For example, 1) establishing a new role without shared understanding among stakeholders, 2) improving product development teams without the relationship of trust, proper tools, and techniques, and 3) proceeding company-wide problem-solving without any history of process improvements and proper leaders.

After this talk, you will get concrete examples of techniques, tools, and solutions to nurture process improvement in this type of organization, to get support and understanding from strongly technology-oriented persons, and to find a point to start your action.
