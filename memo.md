**Everything from Scratch: Practical Ideas in an Organization without a Concept of Process Improvement**


# Scratchの定義
1. Establish a new role
    - role definition
2. Improve product development teams
    - improvement experience and skills
        - 信頼関係ないところから
        - ツール開発（Ayaperf/Sebas）
3. Proceed company-wide problem-solving
    - company-wide problem-solving
        - 各チームでのまとまりのなさ
        - Onboarding


# Memo
・特に2017年頃から、LINEの主要サービスで本番障害が多発し始め、ユーザー・売上へのマイナスの影響が大きくなり始めてきた。
・一方で、この課題を自分ごととして認識し、イニシアチブをとって改善しようとする人がほぼ皆無で、改善の兆しも見えなかった。
・LINEの企業文化的にも技術偏重で、プロセス改善のアイデアを持つ人・イニシアチブをとって改善しようとする人がほとんどいなかった。
・LINE自体、アジャイルは普及していなかった。
・シニアマネージャーの提案で、ScrumMaster・DevOpsエンジニア・SETの3職を新たに追加したが…


# Specialities
Can you make this a more personal story?
- what were the special challenges?
- what were the creative solutions?
- What makes this experience different?
    - Every organization adopting agile for the first time faces challenges.


## Uniqueness of SET
- You may have an unique angle by telling us more about your experience as the first member of the "SET" (Software Engineer in Test) team.
- Was this a new role in your organization?
- Why was this role created?
- What were some of the challenges you faced?



# 要確認
The Information about the Experience is a little better, but here too
I think there are opportunities for improvement.

# "Solved problems and improved processes"
- What kinds of problems did you encounter?
- What kinds of processes did you improve?
- What was meant by, "Clarified responsibilities and activities"?



# Abstract

## Paper
In this experience report, I present practical ideas to establish a new role, to improve product development teams, and to proceed company-wide problem-solving from scratch in the very strongly technology-oriented company without a concept of process improvement.
LINE Corporation has been growing very rapidly and globally. However, the company had been struggling with increase of outages and they had given negative impacts to users and company's profits. Since I joined LINE Corporation as the first member of “SET” (Software Engineer in Test) in 2017, I and our team have been solving a wide variety of problems including reduction of outages by combining technical solutions and Agile methodologies based on my experiences as an Agile Coach. We have been pursuing "best for our users and business" fiercely and relentlessly with a series of experiments. Now, some teams in our company utilize our ideas that we created from scratch.


## Revised
If you need to start totally new activities in an organization which doesn't know a concept of process improvement, what should you do at first? Especially in the very strongly technology-oriented one with urgent critical business issues?

It is very hard to get support and understanding from decision makers and colleagues in such an environment and situation. However, it is more difficult to proceed radically new actions alone. Therefore, we need to obtain consent from them to go ahead.

I experienced that creating solutions "from scratch" by combining technical solutions and Agile methodologies worked well in these challenging conditions.

In this talk, I will provide you practical ideas we reflected, experimented, and succeeded as SET in LINE Corporation. For example, 1) establishing a new role without shared understanding among stakeholders, 2) improving product development teams without relationship of trust, proper tools and techniques, and 3) proceeding company-wide problem-solving without any history of process improvements and proper leaders.

After this talk, you will get concrete examples of techniques, tools, and solutions to nurture process improvement in this type of organization, to get support and understanding from strongly technology-oriented persons, and to find a point to start your action.
