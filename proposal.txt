# Abstract
If you need to start totally new activities (like Agile Adoption) in your organization, what should you do at first? You may face with discrepancies of objectives and responsibilities for your activities among stakeholders. Moreover, you may discover hidden needs that stakeholders haven't distinguished yet. When you are proceeding entirely new approaches and actions, it is inevitable to face a wide variety of challenges continuously. For instance, your activities may not work as you expected. Your supervisor may request you to expand your activities beyond your responsibilities.

For overcoming these situations, you need to update yourselves continuously to meet your moving goals.

In this talk, I will provide you clear experiences and patterns for solving problems by combining Technical excellence, Agile methodologies, and iterative experiments as SET in LINE Corporation.
Additionally, I will tell you the importance of updating ourselves continuously with our concrete experiences and examples: from software quality to software delivery, profitability, and organizational processes.

After this talk, you will understand a value, strength, and possibility of becoming a team of Transformational Leaders!



# Lessons Learned from Your Experience
‚≠êÔ∏è
Agile methodology with Technical Excellence is very important + contribution to business
For overcoming these situations, you need to update yourselves continuously to meet your moving goals.

Learning outcomes is simply a brief list of 3-5 clear takeaways
that attendees will be able to do as a result of attending your session.
They should not suggest what attendees will take back to work,
but what they learned or practiced within the session.

To construct them well, ask yourself the specific topics you are addressing. For example:

Lots of WIP sources
What happens with excess WIP
There are tools to increase focus

Now you want to assign a level of action you think they could achieve as a result of attending your session:
- IDENTIFY various sources of WIP
- ARTICULATE the impact of excess WIP
- APPLY simple tools to create focus

This clarity will allow your potential attendees have a very clear understanding of
what they will get from the session so that they can better prioritize the sessions
they attend based on their needs.
