# Abstract
⭐️
Since I joined LINE Corporation as the first member of “SET” (Software Engineer in Test) in 2017, we have been solving a variety of software and organizational problems.
Through these achievements, we have been adjusting our responsibilities from software quality to software delivery, profitability, and organizational processes.
This report is about why and how we are becoming a team of Transformational Leaders that is responsible for software delivery performance and organizational culture based on experiments.
