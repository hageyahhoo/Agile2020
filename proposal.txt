# Abstract
If you need to start totally new activities (like Agile Adoption) in your organization, what should you do at first? You may face with discrepancies of objectives and responsibilities for your activities among stakeholders. Moreover, you may discover hidden needs that stakeholders haven't distinguished yet. When you are proceeding entirely new approaches and actions, it is inevitable to face a wide variety of challenges continuously. For instance, your activities may not work as you expected. Your supervisor may request you to expand your activities beyond your responsibilities.

For overcoming these situations, you need to update yourselves continuously to meet your moving goals.

In this talk, I will provide you clear experiences and patterns for solving problems by combining Technical excellence, Agile methodologies, and iterative experiments as SET in LINE Corporation.
Additionally, I will tell you the importance of updating ourselves continuously with our concrete experiences and examples: from software quality to software delivery, profitability, and organizational processes.

After this talk, you will understand a value, strength, and possibility of becoming a team of Transformational Leaders!


# Lessons Learned from Your Experience
- Agile methodologies and techniques work for starting up new roles and teams. Especially, Product Discovery, Iterative and Incremental Consensus, and showing results iteratively are very powerful techniques for attracting colleagues and decision makers.
- Working closely with product development teams is very effective for improving processes and achieving missions as an SET and/or an Agile Coach. Showing working examples enriched communication rather than just providing guidelines and references. Moreover, struggling with the same problems, considering solutions, and solving them by working together constructs real collaborative relationships with product development teams.
- It is necessary to adjust my/our responsibilities continuously to meet my/our moving goals based on continuous experiments. Finding and solving problems gradually and extensively by combining technical excellence and Agile methodologies for contributing to our business is a key to success.


# Information about the Experience
I am the first member of "SET" (Software Engineer in Test) in LINE Corporation. I joined LINE Corporation in 2017 and became the leader of SET team in 2019.

From the start of my career in LINE Corporation, I have been solving a variety of software and organizational problems.

1) Clarified responsibilities and activities of SET (team) by utilizing Agile methodologies and techniques

2) Solved problems and improved processes of each product development team by working collaboratively and deeply with them. We experimented a variety of tools and Agile methodologies through these activities.
3) Expanded our activities toward engineering management improvement. We experimented "Learning Session" and utilizing Test Automation for resiliency. Through these activities, we transformed us as a team of "Transformational Leaders".

I spend A LOT of times thinking about and playing games (experiential learning!)
‚Ä¢ I host Agile Games Night (Games for Agility, Learning and Engagement) in Kansas
City. I get to practice games (and debriefing!) frequently! That being said, I am very
cognizant of when/where/why to promote game play for learning and will include
that insight in the presentation.
‚Ä¢ I am certified to teach a Master Game Design through Innovation Games/Conteneo.
‚Ä¢ I am a licensed Agile Fluency Game facilitator
I was a first time presenter at Agile2018 conference last year! In addition, I am a frequent
