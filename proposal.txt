# Abstract
‚≠êÔ∏è
Since I joined LINE Corporation as the first member of ‚ÄúSET‚Äù (Software Engineer in Test) in 2017, we have been solving a variety of software and organizational problems.
Through these achievements, we have been adjusting our responsibilities from software quality to software delivery, profitability, and organizational processes.
This report is about why and how we are becoming a team of Transformational Leaders that is responsible for software delivery performance and organizational culture based on experiments.


üîµ
The abstract is the marketing content for your session.
Design it to persuade people to attend.
Many good abstracts begin with a startling statement or compelling question.
Defining a problem statement and making a call to action can be an effective technique.
Great abstracts draw on readers‚Äô emotions,
such as appealing to a pain they are feeling or an idea about which they are excited.

To do this, you need to understand your primary audience.
Communicating directly to them is key to a good submission.
Although there is a dropdown list to select audience level,
include details here such as,
‚ÄúThis session is targeted at senior managers inside the company
who want to introduce XP and Scrum but are not sure how to get started.‚Äù

Consider providing a description of your presentation format, exercises, or activities you intend to include.
This helps attendees understand what to expect at your session and decide
whether it will be valuable to them.

Above all, ensure your abstract is well-written and your ideas are clearly articulated.
It should be free of grammatical and spelling mistakes.



# Lessons Learned from Your Experience
‚≠êÔ∏è
Agile methodology with Technical Excellence is very important + contribution to business

üîµ
Learning outcomes is simply a brief list of 3-5 clear takeaways
that attendees will be able to do as a result of attending your session.
They should not suggest what attendees will take back to work,
but what they learned or practiced within the session.

To construct them well, ask yourself the specific topics you are addressing. For example:

Lots of WIP sources
What happens with excess WIP
There are tools to increase focus

Now you want to assign a level of action you think they could achieve as a result of attending your session:
- IDENTIFY various sources of WIP
- ARTICULATE the impact of excess WIP
- APPLY simple tools to create focus

This clarity will allow your potential attendees have a very clear understanding of
what they will get from the session so that they can better prioritize the sessions
they attend based on their needs.
