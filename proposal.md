# Abstract
If you need to start totally new activities in an organization which doesn't know a concept of process improvement, what should you do at first? Especially in the very strongly technology-oriented one with urgent critical business issues?

It is very hard to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues in such an environment and a situation. However, it is more difficult to proceed with radically new actions alone. Therefore, we need to obtain consent from them to go ahead.

I experienced that creating solutions "from scratch" by combining technical solutions and Agile methodologies worked well in these challenging conditions.

In this talk, I will provide you practical ideas we reflected, experimented, and succeeded as SET in LINE Corporation. For example, 1) establishing a new role without shared understanding among stakeholders, 2) improving product development teams without the relationship of trust, proper tools, and techniques, and 3) proceeding company-wide problem-solving without any history of process improvements and proper leaders.

After this talk, you will get concrete examples of techniques, tools, and solutions to nurture process improvement in this type of organization, to get support and understanding from strongly technology-oriented persons, and to find a point to start your action.


# ⭐️Lessons Learned from Your Experience
- Agile methodologies and techniques work for starting up new roles and teams. Especially, Product Discovery, Iterative and Incremental Consensus, and showing results iteratively are very powerful techniques for attracting colleagues and decision-makers.
- Working closely with product development teams is very effective for improving processes and achieving missions as an SET and/or an Agile Coach. Showing working examples enriched communication rather than just providing guidelines and references. Moreover, struggling with the same problems, considering solutions, and solving them by working together constructs real collaborative relationships with product development teams.
- It is necessary to adjust my/our responsibilities continuously to meet my/our moving goals based on continuous experiments. Finding and solving problems gradually and extensively by combining technical excellence and Agile methodologies for contributing to our business is a key to success.


# ⭐️Information about the Experience
I am the first member of "SET" (Software Engineer in Test) in LINE Corporation. I joined LINE Corporation in 2017 and became the leader of SET team in 2019.

From the start of my career in LINE Corporation, I have been solving a variety of software and organizational problems.

⭐️Establish set role by attracting decision-makers and colleagues
1) Clarified responsibilities and activities of SET (team) by utilizing Agile methodologies and techniques

⭐️Innovate solutions and processes by experiencing hardships together
2) Solved problems and improved processes of each product development team by working collaboratively and deeply with them. We experimented a variety of tools and Agile methodologies through these activities.

⭐️Transform the organization with built-in experiments and learnings
3) Expanded our activities toward engineering management improvement. We experimented "Learning Session" and utilizing Test Automation for resiliency. Through these activities, we transformed us as a team of "Transformational Leaders".
