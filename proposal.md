# Abstract
⭐️テストであることを、もっと強調したほうがよいやも
If you are hired and appointed as a leader to solve an urgent and critical business issue by the company, what should you do at first? How do you proceed your activities?

In my case, I was hired by LINE Corporation, a very fast-growing company which mainly provides a free message, voice calls and video calls service for smartphones globally. I was appointed as the first member of SET (Software Engineer in Test) to solve the steep increase of outages in one service for enterprise users. These outages often stopped lots of enterprise users' services and lost both users and our company's sales and profits. Sometimes, LINE Corporation gave administrative guidance from government agencies. Therefore, solving this problem was the high-priority mission to our company.

In this talk, I will tell you the following ideas:

1) Importance and how to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues
They are critical to proceed test-related improvement activities. I will explain useful techniques through my experience of establishing a role of SET in LINE Corporation, "Product Discovery" to discover their real concerns, and "Giving impacts" to attract them.

2) Experiencing hardships with product development teams together is a key to proceed activities
We learned that we could provide innovative ideas and solutions by working closely with product development teams. I will explain through our experience of inventing and improving our failure detection system with Karate framework.

3) "Sebas Report": Our innovative solution example to tame complexity of Microservices and reduce their outages
I will introduce you our solution as an improvement example by linking Test Automation, CI/CD, DevOps, and Monitoring techniques. Additionally, I will tell you "Learning Session", a way to nurture members, teams, and organizations and one key element to invent "Sebas Report".

I hope these ideas will help innvation of your testing activities.
