# Abstract
If you are hired and appointed as a leader to solve an urgent and critical business issue by the company, what should you do at first? How do you proceed your activities?

In my case, I was hired by LINE Corporation, a very fast-growing company which mainly provides a free message, voice calls and video calls service for smartphones globally. I was appointed as the first member of SET (Software Engineer in Test) to solve the steep increase of outages in one service for enterprise users. These outages often stopped lots of enterprise users' services, and lost both users and our company's sales and profits. Sometimes, LINE Corporation gave administrative guidance from Japanese government agencies. Therefore, solving this problem was the high-priority mission to our company.


# 何を話すか
In this talk,

I will tell you

as SET

1. 味方を増やす
    - アプローチそのものは同じでも良いが、書き方変える。
1) establishing a new role without shared understanding among stakeholders
to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues
by giving impacts



2. Failure Detection -> 一緒にやって解決
    - 最初は、こちらから提供した -> 定着せず。しかし課題認識の共有の一歩になった
    - 一緒に働くことで、Karateの適用へ。
        - Developer Testingが、結果的に効果あった + Coachingの価値（代行ではないよ）
2) improving product development teams without the relationship of trust, proper tools, and techniques


3. Identification of failures quickly -> 世界的に例のない話 with Learning Session
    - こういう解決をした -> CI/CDとかLean Startupとか
    - そこで役に立ったのがLearning Session
3) proceeding company-wide problem-solving without any history of process improvements and proper leaders.

creating solutions "from scratch"
by combining technical solutions and Agile methodologies


I will provide you practical ideas we reflected, experimented, and succeeded as SET in LINE Corporation.

Mission
- very difficult
- technically
- and company-level
- without supporters
- Microservices -> need to investigate dependency


# Focus on Abstract
1. Preparation : Get support & know products
2. Work together to over silos (Karate & Ayapert)
3. Tame MSA (Sebas)

⭐️Original
If you need to start totally new activities in an organization which doesn't know a concept of process improvement, what should you do at first? Especially in the very strongly technology-oriented one with urgent critical business issues?

It is very hard to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues in such an environment and a situation. However, it is more difficult to proceed with radically new actions alone. Therefore, we need to obtain consent from them to go ahead.

I experienced that creating solutions "from scratch" by combining technical solutions and Agile methodologies worked well in these challenging conditions.

In this talk, I will provide you practical ideas we reflected, experimented, and succeeded as SET in LINE Corporation. For example, 1) establishing a new role without shared understanding among stakeholders, 2) improving product development teams without the relationship of trust, proper tools, and techniques, and 3) proceeding company-wide problem-solving without any history of process improvements and proper leaders.

After this talk, you will get concrete examples of techniques, tools, and solutions to nurture process improvement in this type of organization, to get support and understanding from strongly technology-oriented persons, and to find a point to start your action.


# Lessons Learned from Your Experience
- Agile methodologies and experiences work well for establishing totally new roles and activities. Especially, verbalizing stakeholders' concerns and sharing them with decision-makers by Product Discovery is very important. Additionally, attracting decision-makers and colleagues by giving impacts continuously is very effective. Establishing SET role in LINE Corporation was analogous to start-up business or building new services to us.

- We could provide innovative ideas and solutions by working closely with product development teams. Especially, experiencing hardships together was an essential factor to find and solve real problems.

- It is necessary to adjust my/our responsibilities continuously to meet my/our moving goals based on continuous experiments. Finding and solving problems gradually and extensively by combining technical excellence and Agile methodologies for contributing to our business is a key to success.

- Incorporating experiments and learnings to the team leads to huge transformation beyond the team. It reaches to the organizational level. In our experience, we utilized "Learning Session" as a key driver to improvements. Additionally, we invented a totally new tool named "Sebas Report" to tame the complexity of Microservices by utilizing Learning Session and continuous experiments.



# Information about the Experience
I am the first member of "SET" (Software Engineer in Test) in LINE Corporation. I joined LINE Corporation in 2017. After a series of improvements, in 2019, we formed a team of SET and became the leader of the team.

From the start of my career as SET in LINE Corporation, our team members and I have been solving a variety of software and organizational problems.

1) Established the role of "SET" by attracting decision-makers and colleagues with Product Discovery and giving impacts to them continuously.

2) Innovated solutions and processes by experiencing hardships with each product development team together. For example, we rebuilt a failure detection system based on the team's needs and preferences.

3) Transformed the organization with built-in experiments and learnings. For example, we proceeded onboarding of our team members smoothly with "Learning Session". Additionally, we invented a new tool named "Sebas Report", which can tame the complexity of Microservices based on this onboarding and holding Learning Session continuously.

The key characteristic of our experiments is achieving a lot of technical and process improvements and innovations from scratch by utilizing a series of experiments frequently and flexibly for contribution to our company and business.

# 方針整理
- "Everything from Scratch" を、"Experience Report" 以外の Track で出してみる
    - これ自体、SETの歴史整理の資料としての価値が出てきたため
    - 仮にrejectされても、LINEとして公開するなどの方策はありそう
- Karate - Sebasにフォーカスした内容で、論文は修正し直す
    - "Experience Report" は、相当簡略化＆specificなものを求めている
