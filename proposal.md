# Abstract
**If you are hired and appointed as a leader to solve an urgent and critical business issue by a company, what should you do at first? How do you proceed with your activities?**

In my case, I was hired by LINE Corporation, a very fast-growing company that mainly provides a free message, voice calls, and video calls service for smartphones globally. I was appointed as the first member of **SET (Software Engineer in Test) to solve the steep increase of outages in one service for enterprise users**. These outages often stopped lots of enterprise users' services and lost both users and our company's sales and profits. Sometimes, LINE Corporation gave administrative guidance from government agencies. Therefore, solving this problem was the high-priority mission of our company.

In this talk, I will tell you the following practical ideas and solutions I found through my experience as SET **from Scratch**:

1) Importance and how to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues
They are critical to proceed with test-related improvement activities. I will explain useful techniques through my experience of establishing the role of SET in LINE Corporation; **"Product Discovery"** to discover their real concerns, and **"Giving impacts"** to attract them.

2) Experiencing hardships with product development teams together is a key to proceed with activities
We learned that we could provide innovative ideas and solutions by working closely with product development teams. I will explain through our experience of inventing and improving our failure detection system with **"Karate" framework**.

3) "Sebas Report": Our innovative solution example to tame the complexity of Microservices and reduce their outages
I will introduce you to our solution as an improvement example by linking Test Automation, CI/CD, DevOps, and Monitoring techniques. Additionally, I will tell you **"Learning Session"**, a way to nurture members, teams, and organizations and one key element to invent **"Sebas Report"**.

I hope these ideas will help innovate your testing activities.



# Learning Outcomes
- Identify the importance and ways **to obtain consent from decision-makers, developers, testers, and other stakeholders** to proceed with test-related improvement activities.

- Identify the importance of **working with product development teams together** to discover and solve blockers and problems for going forward improvements.

- **Link Test Automation, CI/CD, DevOps, and Monitoring** to tame the complexity of Microservices and reduce their outages.

- Identify ideas to nurture members, teams, and organizations for a series of activities mentioned above smoothly and quickly.



# Prerequisite Knowledges

## Preferable
- Skills and/or experiences of **developing applications**
- Skills and/or experiences of **writing test scripts** (Unit Test, Integration Test, API Test, UI E2E Test, etc.)
- Skills and/or experiences of building **CI/CD** mechanism
- (Rough) understanding of **Microservice Architecture (MSA)**
- Passions to enjoy overcoming hurdles

## Optional
- Experiences of **leading/coaching Test Automation/DevOps activities** in your organization

- (Rough) understanding of **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**



# Information for Program Team
I'm planning to switch my talks and group discussions among attendees iteratively to make attendees consider their own ideas deeply.

I hope to provide pens, sticky notes, and papers for supporting group discussions.

Here is my rough plan.

2. Importance and how to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues
    - (Discussion) What blocks/blocked Test Automation in your organization (5 min)
    - Talk (15 min)
3. Experiencing hardships with product development teams together is a key to proceed with activities
    - (Discussion) How to persuade developers who stopped writing test scripts (5 min)
    - Talk (15 min)
4. "Sebas Report": Our innovative solution example to tame the complexity of Microservices and reduce their outages
    - (Discussion) What is the difficulty of testing Microservices (5 min)
    - Talk (15 min)
5. Conclusion (5 min)
6. Q&A (5 min)
