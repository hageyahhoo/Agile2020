# Abstract
If you proceed with improvement activities, like introducing Test Automation to your team, you may face with some challenges. Some members and/or teams may oppose your activities. You may find that no one uses tools or solutions you introduced. You may face with shortage of members who have enough skills and knowledge.

In this talk, I will tell you the following practical ideas and solutions which **relate to testing** I found through my experience as **SET (Software Engineer in Test) from Scratch**:

1) Importance and how to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues
They are critical to proceed with test-related improvement activities. I will explain useful techniques; **"Product Discovery"** to discover their real concerns, and **"Giving impacts"** to attract them.

2) Experiencing hardships with product development teams together is a key to proceed with activities
We learned that we could provide innovative ideas and solutions by working closely with product development teams. I will explain it through our experience of inventing and improving our failure detection system with **"Karate" framework**.

3) How to nurture members/teams/organizations for your innovative activities
Innovative activities require proper skills, knowledge, persons, and so on. I will tell you **"Learning Session"**, a way to nurture members, teams, and organizations smoothly and quickly. Additionally, I will explain **"Sebas Report"**, our innovative solution example to tame the complexity of Microservices and reduce their outages incubated from Learning Session.

I hope these ideas will help innovate your testing activities.



# Learning Outcomes
- Identify the importance and ways **to obtain consent from decision-makers, developers, testers, and other stakeholders** to proceed with test-related improvement activities.

- Identify the importance of **working with product development teams together** to discover and solve blockers and problems for going forward improvements.

- Identify ideas to nurture members, teams, and organizations for a series of activities mentioned above smoothly and quickly.

- `(Optional)` **Link Test Automation, CI/CD, DevOps, and Monitoring** to tame the complexity of Microservices and reduce their outages.



# Prerequisite Knowledges
Anybody is welcome who has experiences of **struggling with disputes about testing among developers, testers, managers, and so on**



# Information for Program Team
I'm planning to switch my talks and group discussions among attendees iteratively to make attendees consider their own ideas deeply.

I hope to provide pens, sticky notes, and papers for supporting group discussions.

Here is my rough plan.

1. Introduction to this session (5 min)
2. Importance and how to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues
    - (Discussion) What blocks/blocked Test Automation in your organization (5 min)
    - Talk (15 min)
3. Experiencing hardships with product development teams together is a key to proceed with activities
    - (Discussion) How to persuade developers who stopped writing test scripts (5 min)
    - Talk (15 min)
4. "Sebas Report": Our innovative solution example to tame the complexity of Microservices and reduce their outages
    - (Discussion) What is the difficulty of testing Microservices (5 min)
    - Talk (15 min)
5. Conclusion (5 min)
6. Q&A (5 min)



# Presentation History
I presented at **Agile 2014** titled **"Technology-Driven/Development"** in the Experience Report track.

Since Agile 2014, I have presented several sessions at conferences about Agile Metrics and utilizing technical excellence for "successful" Agile adoption.
Additionally, I have held several workshops about Agile Metrics and Learning Session.

Highlights include:

# Presentations
- "Conquer CI Server!" at Agile Japan 2015
- "Shake up the Culture with Automation!" at DevOps Summit 2016 in Chinese Taipei as a keynote speaker
- "A Practical Guide for Agile Metrics" at Regional Scrum Gathering Tokyo 2017
- "The Truth of Improvements in LINE Corporation" at DevOps Days Tokyo 2018
- "Build Self-Organized Team through Test Automation with Karate" at DevOps Days Taipei 2019
- "SET Team as A Special Task Force: A Practical Guide for Agile Adoption by Combining Technical Excellence and Experiments" at Regional Scrum Gathering Tokyo 2020

# Workshops
- "Visualize It! with Agile Metrics" at Agile Japan 2017
- "Learning Session in Practice" at DevOps Days Taipei 2019

# Memo
## Feedback from Lisa (2020/01/27)
I love the proposed content and the format with group discussions.
I am glad to see you included a failure story, because people learn the most from those.

I think this has potential to be a great learning experience
and perhaps generate some new ideas from participants.
